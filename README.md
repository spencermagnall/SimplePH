# SimplePH
A simple Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics Code written in C
## Description
SimplePH is a lightweight code for solving the Euler Equations using the Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics Method.
It is not intended to be a highly optimized production code, as excellent codes such as GASOLINE, GADGET2 and PHANTOM already furfill this requirement.
This code is largely based of a course given by Daniel Price on SPH and the accompanying paper (10.1016/j.jcp.2010.12.011). 
## Getting Started

### Compiling and Running a Simulation 

* How/where to download your program
* Any modifications needed to be made to files/folders

## Visulisation of Results
Dump files for a completed simulation are in a ascii format with the prefix "snap_" and can be visuallised using the plotting software of your choice. However, I recommend using SPLASH, which can be downloaded from https://users.monash.edu.au/~dprice/splash/. SPLASH has many useful features
