# SimplePH
A simple Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics Code written in C
## Description
SimplePH is a lightweight code for solving the Euler Equations using the Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics Method.
It is not intended to be a highly optimized production code, as excellent codes such as GASOLINE and GADGET2 already furfill this requirement.
## Getting Started

### Compiling and Running a Simulation 

* How/where to download your program
* Any modifications needed to be made to files/folders

## Visulisation of Results
Dump files for a completed simulation are in a ascii format with the prefix "snap_". For visulisation I recommend using SPLASH (*link to splash here*)
